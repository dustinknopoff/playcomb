<h2>About this island</h2>
<hr />
<p>
Parents and caretakers are equally important users of playgrounds! This <i>parent island</i> is elevated and has 360 degrees of seating to provide the best visibility possible for parents to watch their children. The removable plexiglass dividers allow for the following of COVID safety guidelines without interfering with visibility. The ramps and railings are made for ease of accessibility and stroller usage. 
</p>
<blockquote>
So have a seat, rest your legs, and keep an eye on your children all from the comfort and safety of the parent island.
