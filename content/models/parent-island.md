<h2>About this island</h2>
<hr />
<p>
Children are not the only ones who benefit from playspaces. Parents and caretakers are just important as users of the space! We know that you as guardians have your hands full, so we designed a space specifically for you. This ‘parent island’ is elevated and has 360 degrees of seating to provide the best visibility possible for you to watch your child. The removable plexiglass dividers allow for the following of COVID safety guidelines without interfering with visibility. And the ramps and railings are made for ease of accessibility and stroller usage. So have a seat, rest your legs, and keep an eye on your children all from the comfort and safety of the parent island.
