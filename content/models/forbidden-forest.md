    <h2>About this island</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
    Discover what lurks in the shadows! Swings and drawbridges stand as props to allow the imagination to soar. Rope swings for cross moats or gaping holes. Discover secrets, hidden under old passageways. Endless possibilities await!
    </p>
    <p>Core to this design, and following our design philosophy of modularity, the pieces of this island and the connector and platform pieces provided by <i>Tarzan</i> island are designed to to fit together. This island was also designed with accessibility in mind, allowing disabled children to make use of the bridge, both on top and beneath, and the ramp (on the platform behind).
