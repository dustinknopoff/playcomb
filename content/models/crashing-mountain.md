"The Symplegades or Clashing Rocks, also known as the Cyanean Rocks, were, according to Greek mythology, a pair of rocks at the Bosphorus that clashed together whenever a vessel went through. They were defeated by Jason and the Argonauts, who would have been lost and killed by the rocks except for Phineus' advice" 

The Crashing Mountain is your sixth stop, mimicking the Cyanean Rocks obstacle. Experience the same fraught journey Jason and the Argonauts endured to retrieve the Golden Fleece. These draw bridges are constantly trying to reach each other and squish unsuspecting boats. So hurry up! Kids will experience with wooden bridge and climbing rock here. What if they fall off? No worries, the soft faux leather mat has their backs.
