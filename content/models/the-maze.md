Want an outdoor maze? No problem! The Maze is a great place for kids who love escape rooms. It is a one-way obstacle journey which kids enter from the entrance and can climb up and down to find ways to exit. Having LED lights indicate the entrance, the exit part is also formed with a slide which is hard for kids to enter in the wrong direction. 
 
Getting feedback from user testing, parents are worried about an enclosed maze structure in which they cannot see their kids and can not run to them immediately. So the maze is an open-up structure with punched holes on the wall which creates airflow that is necessary during the pandemic and also easier for parents to look out for their kids.  

The maze is about 4 hexagons in size which is spaced out. kids can start entering the maze when others are in the middle of finishing up the journey. The maze contains interactive light paddles, tunnels, wooden climb, slides, and many interactive functionalities which kids can never get bored with.
