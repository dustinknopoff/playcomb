    Want an outdoor maze? No problem! <i>The Maze</i> is a great place for kids who love escape rooms. It is a one-way obstacle journey which kids enter from the entrance and can climb up and down to find ways to exit. Having LED lights indicate the entrance, the exit part is also formed with a slide which is hard for kids to enter in the wrong direction.
