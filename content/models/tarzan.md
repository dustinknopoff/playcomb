Inspired by Tarzan, Tarzan encompasses the freedom of "gliding through trees." Low platforms, rings, zipline and monkey bars provide the experience of climbing trees with the stability of modern playground structures. It is the second stop of the adventure through nature.

This simple play structure features our design philosophy of multiplicity,  allowing multiple children to experience climbing from tree to tree, in a joint experience, at safe distances from each other. This structure also further features our other design philosophy of modularity. The red climbing pieces, monkey bars, ring bars and a zipline, serve as a type of ‘connector’ piece that connects two platforms, which are like ‘anchor’ pieces. In this way, the Tarzan island can be built with a varying number of hexagons, and changed into any form that a given space allows.
